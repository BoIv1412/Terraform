# Terraform for MLSA project
This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing the infrastructure required to deploy the Marathon project. Marathon is a three-layer application developed for sprints and team collaboration within the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors initiative, combining Node.js and ASP .NET technologies.

# Infrastructure Components
The Terraform configurations in this repository manage the following infrastructure components:

Resource Groups: Creation of resource groups to logically organize and manage the resources deployed for the Marathon project.

Azure App Service Plans: Provisioning of Azure App Service Plans to host and manage the web applications developed using Node.js and ASP .NET technologies.

Azure SQL Database: Deployment of Azure SQL Database instances to store and manage the application data securely.

Azure Cache for Redis: Configuration of Azure Cache for Redis to provide high-performance caching for the Marathon application, enhancing its scalability and responsiveness.

Add any additional infrastructure components managed by Terraform, such as networking resources, storage accounts, or virtual machines, as applicable to your project.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites:

Install Terraform by following the official Terraform installation guide.
Configure access to your Azure subscription by providing the necessary credentials or authentication tokens.
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd terraform-marathon
Configuration:

Customize the Terraform configuration files (main.tf, variables.tf, etc.) in the repository according to your infrastructure requirements, specifying details such as resource names, sizes, and configurations.
Initialize Terraform:

csharp
Copy code
terraform init
Review and Apply Changes:

Review the execution plan to ensure that Terraform will create the intended infrastructure resources without errors:

Copy code
terraform plan
Apply the changes to provision the infrastructure resources:

Copy code
terraform apply
Access the Provisioned Infrastructure:

Once Terraform applies the changes successfully, access the provisioned infrastructure resources through the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.
# Additional Considerations
Cost Management: Monitor and manage the cost of the provisioned infrastructure to avoid unexpected expenses, leveraging cost estimation tools provided by Azure.

Scaling: Implement auto-scaling policies and strategies to dynamically adjust the infrastructure capacity based on workload demands and performance metrics.

Backup and Disaster Recovery: Establish backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity in case of infrastructure failures.
